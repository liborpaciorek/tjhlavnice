PLAYER DEFAULT IMAGE IMPLEMENTATION - SUMMARY
==========================================

âœ… COMPLETED CHANGES:

1. STATIC IMAGE SETUP:
   - Created directory: static/images/players/
   - Generated default player image: default_player.png
   - Added documentation: README.txt with setup instructions

2. TEMPLATE MODIFICATIONS:
   - Updated: templates/football/team_lineup.html
   - Modified all 4 player position sections:
     * Goalkeepers (red borders)
     * Defenders (blue borders) 
     * Midfielders (green borders)
     * Forwards (orange borders)

3. FALLBACK LOGIC:
   - Before: Used generic user icon when no player photo
   - After: Uses soccer player default image when no player photo
   - Maintains same styling and borders per position

4. IMAGE SPECIFICATIONS:
   - Size: 300x300 pixels (can be replaced with attachment image)
   - Format: PNG with transparency support
   - Style: Circular crop, object-cover scaling
   - Border: Position-specific color coding

ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS FOR USER:

To use the actual soccer player image from the attachment:
1. Save the soccer player image (red/white jersey)
2. Resize to 300x300 pixels (recommended)
3. Save as: static/images/players/default_player.png
4. Replace the current placeholder image

ðŸŽ¯ RESULT:
All players without uploaded photos now display the default soccer player image instead of a generic icon, creating a more professional and visually appealing team roster page.
